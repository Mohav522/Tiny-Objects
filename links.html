<h1> The Tiny Objects </h1>
<p> This is a collection of small objects. These objects are either miniature, tiny, or itty bitty versions of their original sized items. Some of these things are real, function items, while others are just for display purposes. Regardless of their style, aesthetic, purpose or functionality, all of these items represent or are tiny versions of larger objects.</p>
